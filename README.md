# Heart-Disease-Detection

Deployment URL :- https://heart-disease-predictor-model.streamlit.app/

# 🫀 Heart Disease Detection using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes.
Built using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm and deployed with **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Live Features
- Interactive user input interface
- Real-time prediction
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Clean and modern UI
- 90% Model Accuracy

## 📊 Dataset Features
The model is trained on medical attributes:
- age
- sex
- cp (Chest Pain Type)
- trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure)
- chol (Cholesterol)
- fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar)
- restecg (Resting ECG)
- thalach (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)
- exang (Exercise Induced Angina)
- oldpeak
- slope
- ca (Number of Major Vessels)
- thal
- target

## 🧠 Model Details
- Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Accuracy: ~90%
